# REHEATFUNQ
REHEATFUNQ is a Python package to estimate regional aggregate heat flow
distributions and to identify (fault-generated) surface heat flow anomalies
through the scatter that is inherent to the regional heat flow.

## Installation
Installing REHEATFUNQ requires a number of common scientific computing packages.
See [Dependencies](#dependencies) below for a list of dependencies that need to
be installed to build REHEATFUNQ. Two uncommon packages that the REHEATFUNQ
installation requires are the [Mebuex](https://github.com/mjziebarth/Mebuex) and
the [loaducerf3](https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/loaducerf3) Python package.
Both packages can be installed with the following commands after all other
dependencies have been installed:
```bash
pip install 'mebuex @ git+https://github.com/mjziebarth/Mebuex'
pip install 'loaducerf3 @ git+https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/loaducerf3'
```
Then, a Pip installation can be performed within the root directory of the
REHEATFUNQ source code to install REHEATFUNQ:
```bash
pip install --user .
```
You can also use one of two Docker files that come with this repository. Use
```bash
sudo docker build -t 'reheatfunq' .
```
to build the Docker image `Dockerfile` based on `python:slim` which includes
updated dependencies and has a short compilation time.

Alternatively, you can build the reproducible `Dockerfile-stable` with fixed
dependencies at the state of the REHEATFUNQ description paper. See the
[REHEATFUNQ documentation](https://mjziebarth.github.io/REHEATFUNQ/) for more
informatio about how to build the `Dockerfile-stable` image.

## Usage
Visit the [REHEATFUNQ documentation](https://mjziebarth.github.io/REHEATFUNQ/)
for usage instructions. A number of Jupyter notebooks are bundled in the
[`jupyter`](jupyter/) directory of the REHEATFUNQ source distribution.

In case that visiting the website is not an option, the documentation can be
built locally by running
```bash
make html
```
from within the `docs` subdirectory. This requires Sphinx with Autodoc and
Napoleon to be installed.

## Citation
If you use REHEATFUNQ, please cite the following paper:

**TODO**

This paper explains the REHEATFUNQ model and discusses a couple of performance
and resilience analyses of the model.

## Dependencies
REHEATFUNQ makes use of a number of software packages. It has the following
dependencies:

| Language | Packages |
| :------: | :------: |
| C++      | boost, Eigen, GeographicLib, OpenMP, CGAL & GMP (both through loaducerf3), |
| Python   | numpy, scipy, Cython, pyproj, loaducerf3, geopandas |

The Jupyter notebooks included with REHEATFUNQ require further Python packages
to run:

| Language | Packages |
| :------: | :------: |
| Python   | pdtoolbox, cmcrameri, cmocean, matplotlib, shapely, flottekarte, cmasher, scikit-learn, joblib, requests |

The package `pdtoolbox` can be installed with the following command:
```bash
pip install 'pdtoolbox @ git+https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/pdtoolbox'
```
The package `flottekarte` can currently be installed with the following
commands (executed in a directory where a `FlotteKarte` subfolder can be
created):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjziebarth/FlotteKarte.git
cd FlotteKarte
bash compile.sh
pip install --user .
```

Furthermore, parts of the [pdtoolbox](https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.2.6.2022.002)
and
[ziebarth_et_al_2022_heatflow](https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/ziebarth-et-al-2022-heat-flow-paper-code)
packages, both licensed under the `GPL-3.0-or-later`, are included in the
`external` folder.
