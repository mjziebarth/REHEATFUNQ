# REHEATFUNQ
REHEATFUNQ is a Python package to estimate regional aggregate heat flow
distributions and to identify (fault-generated) surface heat flow anomalies
through the scatter that is inherent to the regional heat flow.

## Installation
Installing REHEATFUNQ requires a number of common scientific computing packages.
See [Dependencies](#dependencies) below for a list of dependencies that need to
be installed to build REHEATFUNQ. Two uncommon packages that the REHEATFUNQ
installation requires are the [Mebuex](https://github.com/mjziebarth/Mebuex) and
the [loaducerf3](https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/loaducerf3) Python package.
Both packages can be installed with the following commands after all other
dependencies have been installed:
```bash
pip install 'mebuex @ git+https://github.com/mjziebarth/Mebuex'
pip install 'loaducerf3 @ git+https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/ziebarth/loaducerf3'
```
Then, a Pip installation can be performed within the root directory of the
REHEATFUNQ source code to install REHEATFUNQ:
```bash
pip install --user .
```
You can also use one of two Docker files that come with this repository. Use
```bash
sudo docker build -t 'reheatfunq' .
```
to build the Docker image `Dockerfile` based on `python:slim` which includes
updated dependencies and has a short compilation time.

Alternatively, you can build the reproducible `Dockerfile-stable` with fixed
dependencies at the state of the REHEATFUNQ description paper. See the
[REHEATFUNQ documentation](https://mjziebarth.github.io/REHEATFUNQ/) for more
informatio about how to build the `Dockerfile-stable` image.

## Usage
Visit the [REHEATFUNQ documentation](https://mjziebarth.github.io/REHEATFUNQ/)
for usage instructions. A number of Jupyter notebooks are bundled in the
[`jupyter`](jupyter/) directory of the REHEATFUNQ source distribution.

In case that visiting the website is not an option, the documentation can be
built locally by running
```bash
make html
```
from within the `docs` subdirectory. This requires Sphinx with Autodoc and
Napoleon to be installed.

## Citation
If you use REHEATFUNQ, please cite the following paper:

**TODO**

This paper explains the REHEATFUNQ model and discusses a couple of performance
and resilience analyses of the model.

created):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjziebarth/FlotteKarte.git

### [Unreleased]
#### Added
- Added a function value cache for the minimum surprise estimate of the gamma
  conjugate prior. The cache can be generated using the
  `GammaConjugatePrior.minimum_surprise_estimate_cache` method and is tied to
  a specific set of heat flow samples and $a_\mathrm{min}$. The function cache
  uses binary search to speed up repetitive calls within the SHGO optimization
  algorithm and can be pickled.
- Added batch evaluation of the maximum Kullback-Leibler distance from a
  reference `GammaConjugatePrior` to a set of other prior parameterizations.
- Enable returning the `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` of the SHGO optimization
  in the gamma conjugate prior minimum surprise estimate.

#### Changed
- Documentation details and fixes
- Github workflow fix
- Minor updates to the notebooks requested in review
- Internal numerics: in `GammaConjugatePrior` normalization use more
  robust determination of the maximum of the α-integration.
- Internal: use `long double` in `GammaConjugatePrior` normalization.
- Change to `pyproject.toml` build system.

### [1.4.0] - 2023-02-01
#### Added
- Added a method `'bli'` to `marginal_posterior_tail_quantiles_batch` that
  uses barycentric Lagrange interpolation of the tail distribution, evaluated
  at Chebyshev points, to represent the tail distribution when performing
  a TOMS 748 inversion of the tail quantile. The implementation follows
  Berruth & Trefethen (2004) *Barycentric Lagrange Interpolation*. This new
  method is the new default in `HeatFlowAnomalyPosterior.tail_quantiles`.
- Added background grid resolution parameters in `GammaConjugatePrior.visualize`

#### Changed
- Rewrote `QuantileInverter` class as a templated class that can work
  with numeric types of different precision.
- Improve unit labelling in `GammaConjugatePrior.visualize`.
